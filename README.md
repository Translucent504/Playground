# Playground
- End Goal: Application that allows an image to be taken of an english passage that has some sort of physics mechanics problem. The application then displays a visual simulation of what the passage said.

# Sub problems to solve:
1. write an OCR that can reliably read english text from an image of a textbook.
2. write some application that allows extraction of the necessary physics / mechanical information (state of objects and their relation etc) from any given english passage.
3. make an app that allows to display a mechanics simulation given some objects and their relations.
